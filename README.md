\*Blah-blah-blah-blah\* __ZeesHUD__. Just a bit more unfucked code-wise.

I am spending my time mainly on fixing minor bugs and making the code legible for editing, also making this HUD debloated from any of additions, just ZeesHUD with the purely technical aspect to it (no custom click sound for a menu HUD label, no custom backgrounds, everything just to shrink the size of an already humongous HUD).
